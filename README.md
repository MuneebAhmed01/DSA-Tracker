Hey there! 👋
This repo is where I’m tracking my journey through Data Structures and Algorithms.

Whenever I solve a problem (mostly on platforms like LeetCode), I drop the solution here — organized by topic like Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, etc. 

💡 Why this repo?

    To keep a personal log of all the problems I’ve solved/Track Problems

    To review/Practice old problems 

    To show my consistency and problem-solving to future me 

    Because it's fun to look back and see the progress

🛠️ Work in Progress

I’m still organizing things — sometimes I upload stuff manually, sometimes with the help of browser extensions
